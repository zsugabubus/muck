.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB muck
.RI  [ OPTION ]...
.RI  [ URL ]...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B muck
is a terminal music player built on top of FFmpeg.
.
.PP
.B master
playlist is populated with the given
.IR URL s.
When no URLs are given and standard input does not refer to a terminal, a
special
.B stdin
playlist is created and playlist file is read from the standard input.
Otherwise a
.B \.
playlist is created and files are read from the current directory.
.
.SS Playlists
.PP
URLs ending in
.RB {\  .m3u " | " .m3u8 " | " .pl " }[ " .bz " | " .bz2 " | " .gz " | " .lz4 " | " .xz " | " .zst \ ]
are treated as (compressed) playlist files.
.PP
Playlist files that start with
.BR #EXTM3U ,
are recognized as M3U playlists and for every media URL metadata is
written to and read from the
.BR #EXTINF \ directive.
Playlists containing unknown comments are marked read-only thus never
overwritten.
.PP
.BI #PLAYLIST: NAME
directive can be used to give a pretty name for a playlist (instead of
referencing to it by its path).
.PP
Playlists are opened once at startup and may be nested without limits.
.PP
Directories are treated like a virtual playlist with the limitation that they
are recognized on the command-line only, i.e. they are neither scanned
recursively nor can be played from inside a playlist. If you would like to
overcome this limitation, use
.BR "find -type f | muck" .
.
.SS Cover art
Cover art is written to
.RB $ MUCK_COVER .
If not set, a suitable location is chosen.
