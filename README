MUCK(1)                     General Commands Manual                    MUCK(1)



NAME
       muck - music player

SYNOPSIS
       muck [OPTION]...  [URL]...

DESCRIPTION
       muck is a terminal music player built on top of FFmpeg.

       When  URLs are given, they are used to populate master playlist. Other‐
       wise a special stdin playlist is created and the playlist file is  read
       from the standard input.

   Playlists
       Files ending in { .m3u | .m3u8 | .pl }[ .bz | .bz2 | .gz | .lz4 | .xz |
       .zst ] are treated as (compressed) playlist files.

       If file starts with #EXTM3U, it is recognized as an  M3U  playlist  and
       for every media URL metadata is written to and read from #EXTINF direc‐
       tive.  Playlists containing unknown comments are marked read-only  thus
       never overwritten.

       #PLAYLIST:NAME  directive  can  be  used to provide a pretty name for a
       playlist instead of referencing to it by its path.

       Playlists are opened only once, immediately after startup  and  may  be
       nested without limits.

       Directories  are  treated  like  a virtual playlist with the limitation
       that they are recognized on the command-line only, i.e. they  are  nei‐
       ther  scanned  recursively  nor  can  be played from a playlist. If you
       would like to overcome this limitation, use find | muck.

   Cover art
       When $MUCK_HOME/cover exists, the cover art of currently  playing  file
       is written to it.

       Note  that it can be a symbolic link (e.g. → /tmp/cover), just be aware
       that some image viewers can detect file time changes on their real path
       only.
