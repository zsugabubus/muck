NAME
       muck - music player

SYNOPSIS
       muck [OPTION]...  [URL]...

DESCRIPTION
       muck is a terminal music player built on top of FFmpeg.

       When URLs are given, they are used to populate master playlist.

       When no URLs are given and standard input does not refer to a terminal,
       a special stdin playlist is created and playlist file is read from  the
       standard input.

       Otherwise  a .  playlist is created and files are read from the current
       directory.

   Playlists
       Files ending in { .m3u | .m3u8 | .pl }[ .bz | .bz2 | .gz | .lz4 | .xz |
       .zst ] are treated as (compressed) playlist files.

       If  file  starts  with #EXTM3U, it is recognized as an M3U playlist and
       for every media URL metadata is written to and read from #EXTINF direc‐
       tive.   Playlists containing unknown comments are marked read-only thus
       never overwritten.

       #PLAYLIST:NAME directive can be used to provide a  pretty  name  for  a
       playlist (instead of referencing to it by its path).

       Playlists  are  opened  only once, immediately after startup and may be
       nested without limits.

       Directories are treated like a virtual  playlist  with  the  limitation
       that  they  are recognized on the command-line only, i.e. they are nei‐
       ther scanned recursively nor can be played  from  a  playlist.  If  you
       would like to overcome this limitation, use find | muck.

   Cover art
       Cover  art  is written to $MUCK_COVER.  If not set, a suitable location
       is chosen.

              WIDTH  specifies  required  column width. When omitted a default
              value is used. As a special case, 0  means  key  should  not  be
              columnized but join it to the previous column.

              nized keys is available in search mode.

       -v     Print version information and exit.
