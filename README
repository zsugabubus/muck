MUCK(1)                     General Commands Manual                    MUCK(1)



NAME
       muck - music player

SYNOPSIS
       muck [OPTION]...  [URL]...

DESCRIPTION
       muck is a minimal music player built on top of FFmpeg. It is written in
       C, so that's where it name comes from: mu-C-k player.

       When URLs are given, they are used to populate master playlist.  Other‐
       wise  a special stdin playlist is created and the playlist file is read
       from the standard input.

   Playlists
       Files ending in { .m3u | .m3u8 | .pl }[ .bz | .bz2 | .gz | .lz4 | .xz |
       .zst ] are treated as (compressed) playlist files.

       If file starts with #EXTM3U it is recognized as an M3U playlist and for
       every media URL metadata is written to and read from #EXTINF directive.
       Playlists  containing  unknown comments are marked read-only thus never
       overwritten.

       #PLAYLIST:NAME directive can be used to provide a  pretty  name  for  a
       playlist instead of referencing to it by its path.

       Playlists  are  opened  only once, immediately after startup and may be
       nested without limits.

       Directories are treated like a virtual  playlist  with  the  limitation
       that  they  are recognized on the command-line only, i.e. they are nei‐
       ther scanned recursively nor can be played  from  a  playlist.  If  you
       would like to overcome this limitation, use find | muck.

   Cover art
       When  $MUCK_HOME/cover  exists, the cover art of currently playing file
       is written to it.

       Note that it can be a symbolic link (e.g. → /tmp/cover), just be  aware
       that some image viewers can detect file time changes on their real path
       only.
